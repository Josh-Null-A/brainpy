# brainpy

Brainpy is my implementation of the esoteric programming language created in 1993 by Urban MÃ¼ller, BrainF**ck.

It is written purley in python as a interpreter, and is my first step towards understanding how programming languages, compilers and interpreters work.

This program is probably more complex than it needs to be. The purpose of this project was to teach myself about compilers so the full package is included, rather than a single file program.
